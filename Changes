Revision history for Class-Plugin-Util

0.005  Sat Aug 11 11:50:00 AM 2007 [asksh@cpan.org]
    -  VERSION BUMP 0.005 Impact: None.
    -  TESTS: Test::Kwalitee, Test::Pod::Coverage, Test::Pod and
       Test::YAML::Meta now changed to author only tests.
    -  REMOVED DEPENDENCY: UNIVERSAL::require
         added new function instead: _require_class($class),
         as this does not add the require function to every single class.
         also it has a class name to filename cache, and tests if the
         class-name passed as parameter actually is a valid Perl class.
